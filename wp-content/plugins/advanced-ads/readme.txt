Manage and optimize your ads and ads performance with support for AdSense, ad injection, ad widget, and ad rotation.

== Description ==

Advanced Ads is a simple ad manager made by a publisher for publishers. Based on my experience delivering millions of ads per month I built this advertising plugin as a powerful, but light weight solution to not only manage and insert banners in WordPress, but to test and optimize them as well.

4. Click 'Install Now'
5. Activate Advanced Ads in the Plugin dashboard

4. Activate Advanced Ads in the Plugin dashboard

== Displaying Ads ==

You can use functions and shortcodes to display ads and ad groups.

The integers in this example are the IDs of the elements.

Use these shortcode to insert an ad or ad group into your post/page.

`[the_ad id="24"]`
`[the_ad_group id="5"]`

Use these functions to insert an ad or ad group into your template file.

`<?php the_ad(24); ?>`
`<?php the_ad_group(5); ?>`

In addition to directly displaying ads and groups you can define ad placements and assign either an ad or group to them.

`[the_ad_placement id="header-left"]`
`<?php the_ad_placement('header-left'); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a revenue share? =

There is no revenue share. Advanced Ads doesn’t alter your ad codes in a way that you earn less than you would directly including the ad code in your template.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create an ad almost like you would create an article or page.
2. Align the ad and set a margin to other elements
3. Choose from various conditions where and where not to display your ad.
4. Placements that let you inject ads anywhere into your site without coding (6 in Advanced Ads + 9 through add-ons)
